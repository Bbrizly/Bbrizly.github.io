          <p><strong>OpenGL Particle System</strong> simulates thousands of particles with physics-based movement, collisions, and custom shaders for eye-catching effects.</p>

<h2 id="particlenode-emitter">ParticleNode (Emitter)</h2>

<p>Represents an emitter in the scene. It holds an optimized array of active particles, and spawns new ones according to rules you choose:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Emission settings (how many particles per second, maximum particles allowed, for how long to emit).
Shapes (point, sphere, box, cone, donut) which define where exactly in space each new particle is placed.
Lifetime ranges (minimum and maximum possible lifetime for each particle).
Size, rotation, and alpha ranges to randomize each new particle’s look.
Gradients over time (for color fading and cool effects).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under the hood, each ParticleNode runs a spawn-update-render loop:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Spawning: Checks if it needs new particles this frame, generates them, randomizing their initial properties within the given ranges.
Updating: For each existing particle:
    Increments its age; if it has outlived its lifetime, it is removed.
    Applies affectors, which might alter velocity, color, scale, etc.
    Moves the particle by updating position or rotation.
Rendering: Sorts the particles (for correct blending) and draws each one as a billboard quad, meaning it always faces the camera. This is done by calculating “right” and “up” vectors from the camera to orient the particles. The system supports normal alpha blending or additive/glow-style blending.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="particle">Particle</h3>

<p>This is just a record of one particle’s position, velocity, color, size, lifetime, etc. These particles come and go according to the emitter’s rules.</p>
<h3 id="affector">Affector</h3>

<p>An affector is a plug-in module that modifies each particle over time. Common examples:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Constant acceleration (like gravity).
Fade-out by reducing alpha as it ages.
Scale from small to large from birth to death.
Towards or Away from a point (attract or repel).
DiePastAxis (kill a particle once it crosses a certain boundary).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each affector runs its logic on every particle during the update phase. It can be combined with others for complex behaviors. Under the hood, each affector simply changes particle fields like velocity, alpha, or position.</p>
<h2 id="workflow-and-configuration">Workflow and Configuration</h2>

<p>To use this system:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Create an emitter node (the system’s primary interface).
Set emitter parameters—such as how quickly to spawn particles, what shapes they appear in, and how big or colorful they are at birth.
Attach any number of affectors to shape their motion or color over time.
Add the emitter node into your scene so it updates and renders.
Start the emitter, or “play” it. Depending on settings, it will either continuously emit new particles (continuous mode) or spawn large bursts at specific times (burst mode).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Beneath the surface, your emitter’s transformation (position, rotation, scale) can be applied to new or existing particles if you choose local space. If you keep it in world space, the emitter’s own movement only affects future particles.</p>
<h2 id="under-the-hood-mechanics">Under the Hood Mechanics</h2>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Spawning
    A small accumulator tracks how many particles should be spawned based on the emission rate and the time step.
    Once enough “spawn budget” accumulates, the system creates new particles in the chosen shape.

Particle Array
    Maintains a limit (maxParticles) to prevent excessive growth.
    The system reuses the array, removing “dead” particles that exceed their lifetime.

Sorting &amp; Billboard Quads
    Just before drawing, the emitter sorts particles by distance to the camera. This ensures the correct blending order so that transparent particles look correct.
    A small chunk of vertex data is built for each particle: two triangles forming a quad, oriented to face the camera.

Affectors
    Each affector’s Apply method is called per particle. They have direct access to the particle fields (position, velocity, color). They might combine the emitter’s world matrix to handle local transformations.

Rendering
    Uses a custom or shared material that can reference a texture (like a smoke texture, flame texture, etc.).
    If “glow” is on, it switches to additive blending, making each particle’s color add up brightly.
    If “glow” is off, it uses alpha blending so particles fade with a typical see-through effect.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="loading-and-saving">Loading and Saving</h2>

<p>The system supports loading and saving configurations in YAML. An emitter or entire “effect” (with multiple emitters) can be stored in a .yaml file describing:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Emitter name, shape, rates, color keys, etc.
Attached affectors (with their relevant fields).
Optional texture paths.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you load such YAML files at runtime, the system reconstructs the emitter or effect. This reduces the need to hardcode particle setups in your project.</p>

<h2 id="effectnode-for-multiple-emitters">EffectNode for Multiple Emitters</h2>

<p>Sometimes you need multiple particle emitters that work together—like an explosion that has sparks, smoke, and shockwave rings. The EffectNode:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Collects child ParticleNodes under one parent.
Let’s you control them all at once (Play, Stop, Pause, etc.).
Can load from an .effect.yaml file that has a list of child emitters with offsets.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under the hood, EffectNode is just a scene Node with children that happen to be ParticleNodes. Its “Play” method simply calls “Play” on every child emitter. You can also transform the entire effect as a group.</p>
